    "- **World dynamics:** Animals move stochastically, plants may die naturally, and animals attempt to eat plants compatible with their diet.  \n",

    " 1. Scope for a Semester-Long Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to model and predict student movement across campus **after their scheduled activities**. Students are categorized as athletes, dancers, or regular students. The project will use **probabilistic and relational modeling** to simulate how students move between campus locations (e.g., cafeteria, library, lounges, outdoor areas) over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key objectives:\n",
    "- Represent student populations with uncertain behavior.\n",
    "- Capture relational dependencies (friends, teammates influence movement).\n",
    "- Simulate dynamic evolution of locations over time steps.\n",
    "- Condition predictions on partial observations (e.g., some students already observed at a location).\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation will generate **thousands of traces** to estimate probabilities and identify patterns of student movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with knowledge of student schedules, the exact **post-activity movement** is uncertain. Students make decisions influenced by personal preference, social groups, and environmental context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to **predict probabilistically where students are likely to go**, accounting for:\n",
    "- Time-of-day effects\n",
    "- Social influence from friends or teammates\n",
    "- Stochastic movement choices\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the simulation to answer questions like:\n",
    "- What is the probability that most athletes will go to the cafeteria at 1 PM?\n",
    "- How does observing a few students at a location update predictions for the rest?\n",

    "3. Relevance of AI Methodologies from the Chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "From *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*, the following concepts apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-Universe Modeling**: The number and behavior of students in each location is uncertain; Monte Carlo traces sample possible worlds.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Models**: Student locations evolve over discrete time steps, forming a stochastic transition process.\n",
    "- **Relational Probabilistic Models**: Friend and team influences create dependencies in movement probabilities.\n",
    "- **Partial Observations / Conditioning**: Observing some students updates posterior probabilities for others.\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Used to approximate distributions over student locations across multiple traces.\n",
    "- **Bayesian Reasoning**: Inference over likely student positions given partial observations.\n",
